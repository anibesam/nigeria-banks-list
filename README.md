## Installation

You can install the package from NPM:

Or, if you are using the package locally during development, you can install it like this:

```bash
npm install /path/to/your/package
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the Package

You can import the `getBanks` and `findBankByCode` functions into your project.

```typescript
import { getBanks, findBankByCode } from 'nigeria-banks-list';
```

### 2. Get All Banks

Use the `getBanks` function to retrieve a list of all Nigerian banks.

```typescript
const allBanks = getBanks();
console.log(allBanks);
```

This will return an array of all Nigerian banks, including commercial, microfinance, and digital banks.

### 3. Find a Bank by Code

Use the `findBankByCode` function to search for a bank using its unique code.

```typescript
const bank = findBankByCode("044"); // Access Bank
console.log(bank);
```

This will return the bank object for Access Bank or `undefined` if the code doesn't match any bank.
